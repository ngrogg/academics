This project was interesting, as I spent an equal amount of time programming,
searching for a data set that wasn't too hard and recording the results.
Machine learning has always been my Achilles heel in programming, even worse
than pointers. I liked that we were given existing code, since I would not
have been able to come up with this on my own in two weeks. I also liked that
there were minimal libraries, as Python can have some incredibly specific
libraries. I did't spend too much time running the actual code as I picked a
simple dataset and have a fairly powerful desktop. I didn't keep exact track
of time but I probably spent around 8 or so hours (not including run-time) on 
this project.
