1) When does the compiler actually generate the code for a function template?
When the function is called (executed).

2) What is the best method for writing a function template?
Use as broad of an approach as possible, the more specific the algorithm is the more limited it is in it's application.
The idea is to have a generic function that can be used for as many things in the program as 
possible.

3) What does the term algorithm abstraction mean?
A generic way to express an algorithm while ignoring incidental details.
